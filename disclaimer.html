      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Naijian Lin</strong> — a certified graduate of the <strong>Institute for Integrative Nutrition (IIN)</strong> and a holistic health coach based in California.  
      My background began in the corporate world, where I spent years working long hours with little balance. Over time, I realized I wanted to help others improve their energy, relationships, and overall well-being through practical, compassionate coaching.</p>

      <p>This website is my personal blog — a space where I share my honest reflections on health coaching, learning experiences, and the lessons I gained during my studies at IIN. Everything here is written from my own perspective as a former student and practicing health coach.</p>

      <h2>My Mission</h2>
      <p>My goal is simple: to share real experiences, helpful resources, and inspiration for people who are exploring health coaching or looking to make positive lifestyle changes.  
      I believe wellness is not about perfection — it’s about progress, awareness, and kindness to ourselves and others.</p>
